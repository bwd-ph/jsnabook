<p>‘Eat Well Move More Shape Up’ is Blackburn with Darwen’s 2017-2020 strategy to make physical activity and healthy eating an easy choice for all <em><span class="citation">(BwDBC <a href="#ref-BwD_EatWell">2017</a><a href="#ref-BwD_EatWell">b</a>)</span></em>.</p>

<div class="scales">
<h4 id="adult-obesity">Adult obesity</h4>
In 2016/17, an estimated 66.4% of Blackburn with Darwen adults were overweight or obese <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_physical">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_physical">u</a>)</span></em>. This is significantly higher than the England average of 61.3%, which of course is far from ideal in itself. Given that they are based on survey responses, these estimates may well be understating the size of the problem <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_physical">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_physical">u</a>)</span></em>.

</div>

<p>  </p>
<p>Public Health England estimates that obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of three years, and severe obesity by 8-10 years <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_adultobese">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_adultobese">b</a>)</span></em>. It has produced an infographic summary of the many ways in which obesity can harm health (Figure <a href="live-well.html#fig:obinfographic">48</a>).</p>

<p>New data from NHS Digital (Figure <a href="live-well.html#fig:obadmitchart">49</a>) shows that Blackburn with Darwen has a rapidly rising rate of hospital admissions where obesity was listed as a factor (though not necessarily the main reason).</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 49: Hospital admissions with a primary or secondary diagnosis of obesity<br/>(age-standardised rate, all ages)
</p>
</div>
<p>The rise over time may be partly due to an increasing tendency to record ‘obesity’ when logging admissions, but it means that in 2016/17, Blackburn with Darwen comes 13th highest out of 152 upper-tier authorities <em><span class="citation">(NHS Digital <a href="#ref-NHSDig_obesityetc">2018</a><a href="#ref-NHSDig_obesityetc">h</a>)</span></em>.</p>

58.5% of adults in Blackburn with Darwen claimed to achieve the recommended ‘5-a-day’ portions of fruit and vegetables in 2016/17, which is similar to the England average of 57.4%. Fruit consumption is close to average, but intake of vegetables in Blackburn with Darwen (2.55 portions per day) is significantly lower than the England average (2.70 portions) <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_PHOF">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_PHOF">w</a>)</span></em>.

The Local Authority Declaration on Healthy Weight, signed in April 2017 by Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council and Blackburn with Darwen CCG, is the first of its kind in the country <em><span class="citation">(BwDBC <a href="#ref-BwD_EatWellYr1">2018</a>; BwDBC <a href="#ref-BwD_declaration">2017</a><a href="#ref-BwD_declaration">c</a>)</span></em>.

<h3>Physical Activity</h3>
<div id="levels-of-activity" class="section level4">
<h4>Levels of Activity</h4>
<p>Public Health England considers us ‘physically active’ if we do the equivalent of 150+ minutes of moderate intensity sporting or fitness activities per week, in bouts of at least 10 minutes. Below 30 minutes is ‘inactive’. With 60.1% of adults ‘active’ and 26.2% ‘inactive’, Blackburn with Darwen is significantly worse than England on both counts (Figure <a href="live-well.html#fig:physactchart">50</a>) <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_physical">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_physical">u</a>)</span></em>.</p>

<h4 id="walking-and-cycling">Walking and Cycling</h4>
In 2016/17, only 67.0% of Blackburn with Darwen adults walked for over 10 continuous minutes, for any purpose, at least once a month (England average 78.4%). This was the lowest proportion out of 326 lower-tier authorities. Blackburn with Darwen is still the lowest if we say ‘walked or cycled’, with only 68.1% doing either at least monthly (England 80.0%) <em><span class="citation">(DfT <a href="#ref-DfT_walking">2018</a>)</span></em>.

<h5 id="what-the-papers-say.-1">What the papers say….</h5>
<p>Research led by King’s College London has found that those who meet the NHS’s ‘150 minutes per week’ physical activity guidelines are 31% less likely to develop depression than those who do not <em><span class="citation">(Daily Telegraph <a href="#ref-DailyTel">2018</a>; KCL <a href="#ref-KCL2017">2018</a>)</span></em>.</p>
<p>This adds to the growing body of evidence that exercise can help to reduce the risk of diabetes, various cancers, hip fractures and cardiovascular disease, improve the health of those who already have chronic disease, and enable older people to remain independent for longer <em><span class="citation">(AMRC <a href="#ref-AMRC2015">2015</a>; RCS <a href="#ref-RCS2017">2017</a>)</span></em>. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges goes so far as to call it the ‘Miracle Cure’ <em><span class="citation">(AMRC <a href="#ref-AMRC2015">2015</a>)</span></em>, and PHE has published advice for health professionals on how to persuade patients of its benefits <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_physicalAOH">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_physicalAOH">v</a>)</span></em>.</p>

<p>The Sport England project in Pennine Lancashire, known as <strong>Together an Active Future</strong> <em><span class="citation">(TAAF <a href="#ref-TAAF">2018</a>)</span></em>, aims to reach out to the many local people who are physically inactive, experiencing poor mental wellbeing, or both. It particularly seeks to harness the benefits of physical activity for mental health, and as a response to stressful life events (Figure <a href="live-well.html#fig:lifecoursechart">52</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>One of the main objectives is to improve our understanding of <em>why</em> people are not more active. Creative engagement techniques, including a ‘Life Course Reflection Tool’, are used to explore how each person’s attitudes and experiences at different ages may have shaped the way they relate to physical activity now <em><span class="citation">(Together a Healthier Future <a href="#ref-TAHF">2018</a>)</span></em>. These conversations have also uncovered a lack of awareness of the physical activity offers that already exist.</p>
<p>For their part, many service providers are unsure how to approach those who are less active, so they welcome the opportunity to talk,think and work together to bring change.</p>

<p>The most recent estimates of alcohol consumption are for 2011-14.

<h4>The Alcohol Harm Paradox</h4>
<p>Given all of the above, it might be assumed that Blackburn with Darwen would have relatively low levels of alcohol-related ill-health. However, it has been known for some time that although deprived populations may <em>drink less</em> than more affluent groups, they are likely to suffer <em>greater harm</em> as a consequence <em><span class="citation">(Marmot <a href="#ref-Marmot">2010</a>)</span></em>. Research into this ‘Alcohol Harm Paradox’ suggests that any given level of alcohol consumption is likely to do more damage to those who also smoke, are overweight or have an unhealthy lifestyle <em><span class="citation">(M.Bellis et al <a href="#ref-Bellis">2016</a>)</span></em>.</p>

An analysis of the 2015/16 figures shows that in Blackburn with Darwen, the crude rate of patients being admitted for alcohol-specific conditions for the 3rd or subsequent time in 24 months was more than twice the national average.

<p>The study confirms that smoking has by far the biggest effect, accounting for 15.1% of all new cancer cases in the UK in 2015, although it is hoped that this proportion will fall in future as smoking rates continue to decline <em><span class="citation">(Brown et al <a href="#ref-Brown">2018</a>)</span></em>.

<h4>Cancer Incidence</h4>
<p>The number of new cases of cancer diagnosed each year is known as the <strong>incidence</strong>. This has tended to rise over time, reflecting both changing risk factors and better diagnosis and recording <em><span class="citation">(PHE &amp; NHS England <a href="#ref-PHE_cancerdata">2018</a>; CRUK <a href="#ref-CRUK_lifestyle">2018</a><a href="#ref-CRUK_lifestyle">a</a>)</span></em>.

<p>Patients who are first diagnosed with cancer when they present as an emergency are known to have a substantially lower survival rate <em><span class="citation">(Elliss Brookes et al <a href="#ref-EllisBrookes">2012</a>)</span></em>. Emergency presentations are particularly common in bowel and lung cancer (Figure <a href="live-well.html#fig:routeschart">66</a>), and for both these types, the proportion detected this way is significantly higher than average in Blackburn with Darwen:</p>

<p>Even though cancer incidence has been increasing, improved survival means that premature mortality from the disease has been gradually declining across England as a whole.

This group are also known as ‘cancer <strong>survivors</strong>’. By the end of 2015 (the most recent year available), there were <strong>4093</strong> cancer survivors in Blackburn with Darwen who had been diagnosed since 1995 <em><span class="citation">(PHE/Macmillan <a href="#ref-PHE_Macmillan">2018</a>)</span></em>. This is a rise of more than 500 since the 2010 prevalence figure quoted in the previous Summary Review.

<h3>Cardiovascular Disease</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular disease, or CVD, is an umbrella term for conditions of the circulatory system, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart failure and rhythmic heart disorders.

In 2014-16, it ranked second highest out of 152 upper-tier authorities in England. Two-thirds of these deaths were from types of CVD from which premature death is considered to be largely preventable, either via behaviour change or through public health measures.

<h4>NHS Health Checks</h4>
<p>The risk factors identified by NICE are exactly the sort of thing clinicians are looking out for in the NHS Health Check for 40-74 year-olds. Three years ago, the rate at which the eligible population was receiving these checks was significantly below average in Blackburn with Darwen. Since then, the situation has been turned around, so that in 2017/18 the proportion of eligible patients receiving a check was 23rd <em>highest</em> out of 152 upper-tier authorities. This is due to a rise in the number of invitations issued, rather than the proportion of invitations accepted (which has actually gone down).</p>
<p>51.2% of the eligible population of Blackburn with Darwen have now had a Health Check since the scheme started. Although better than England (44.3%), the Borough still has some way to go to match Walsall, at 98.9% - or even Bolton, which comes second with 91.7% <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_PHOF">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_PHOF">w</a>)</span></em>. .</p>

<h5>Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)</h5>
<p>The IAPT programme focuses on providing ‘talking therapies’ for people experiencing common mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. Referral rates are generally higher in deprived areas, but success rates are lower <em><span class="citation">(House of Commons Library <a href="#ref-HCL_MH">2018</a><a href="#ref-HCL_MH">a</a>)</span></em>.

<p>An IAPT referral has ‘moved to recovery’ if their symptoms of anxiety or depression were severe enough to be regarded as a clinical case at the start of their treatment, but not by the end of it <em><span class="citation">(NHS Digital <a href="#ref-NHSDig_psych">2018</a><a href="#ref-NHSDig_psych">c</a>)</span></em>.

<h5>Specialist Mental Health Services</h5>
<p>At the end of 2017/18, the proportion of adults in Blackburn with Darwen in contact with adult specialist (or ‘secondary’) mental health and learning disability services was the highest in the country, at 6405 per 100,000 (England average 2329) <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_SevereMH">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_SevereMH">y</a>)</span></em>.

<p>Greater Preston and East Lancashire CCGs follow in second and third place, creating a distinct geographical cluster of high access to services.

<p>It is reassuring that the borough only had three ‘late’ diagnoses in the three years up to 2017.

<p>As can be seen from Figure <a href="live-well.html#fig:liverchart">78</a>, premature mortality from liver disease in Blackburn with Darwen is high and rising <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_Liverprofile">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_Liverprofile">m</a>)</span></em>. In 2014-16, the borough had the second highest under-75 death rate after Blackpool.</p>

<p>Mortality from liver disease is strongly associated with deprivation <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_Liverprofile">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_Liverprofile">m</a>; FLR <a href="#ref-FLR_Liver">2017</a>)</span></em>, and disproportionately affects younger people <em><span class="citation">(FLR <a href="#ref-FLR_Liver">2017</a>)</span></em>. 85% of all those dying from liver disease in Blackburn with Darwen in 2014-16 were under the age of 75.</p>
<p>The main risk factors for liver disease are <a href="live-well.html#alcohol-adults">alcohol</a>, <a href="live-well.html#adult-obesity">obesity</a>, and viral hepatitis <em><span class="citation">(FLR <a href="#ref-FLR_Liver">2017</a>; PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_Liveratlas">2017</a><a href="#ref-PHE_Liveratlas">f</a>)</span></em>.</p>

<div id="viral-hepatitis" class="section level4">
<h4>Viral Hepatitis</h4>
<p>Hepatitis B and C are blood-borne viruses, most commonly spread through sexual contact and injecting drug use respectively <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_Liveratlas">2017</a><a href="#ref-PHE_Liveratlas">f</a>)</span></em>. They do not always give rise to symptoms, so a high proportion of cases go undetected <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_Liveratlas">2017</a><a href="#ref-PHE_Liveratlas">f</a>)</span></em>. Public Health England estimates that Blackburn with Darwen may have around 1207 residents infected with Hepatitis C, including 869 current or former drug users. Most of the remaining cases are assumed to be among people with links to Pakistan, which has a high background prevalence <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_hepC">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_hepC">j</a>)</span></em>.</p>
<p>The Pennine Lancashire Liver Disease Framework emphasises the importance of awareness-raising, immunisation (Hep B) and testing among groups particularly susceptible to viral hepatitis <em><span class="citation">(LDP <a href="#ref-PL_liver">2017</a>)</span></em>. Engagement and testing initiatives organised by Baiter Sehat (‘Better Health’) have been positively received by the Pakistani heritage community <em><span class="citation">(One Voice <a href="#ref-OneVoice_hep">2017</a><a href="#ref-OneVoice_hep">b</a>; Shuttle <a href="#ref-Sh_hep">2016</a>)</span></em>.</p>

<p>In February 2018, Employment Support Allowance (ESA) was being claimed by 8096 Blackburn with Darwen residents unable to work because of long-term health problems <em><span class="citation">(DWP <a href="#ref-DWP_tool">2018</a>)</span></em>.

<p>The 8096 recipients of ESA equates to 8.7% of the working-age population of Blackburn with Darwen, which is the 11th highest rate out of 152 upper-tier authorities.

<p>Like visual impairment, hearing loss is closely related to many of the other issues considered in this JSNA (Figure <a href="live-well.html#fig:hearingchart">81</a>). NHS hearing aids have been shown to be a cost-effective way of reducing many of the negative impacts shown.</p>

<h3>Road Safety</h3>
<div id="overall-casualties" class="section level4">
<h4>Overall Casualties</h4>
<p>In Blackburn with Darwen in 2016 there were 552 recorded road traffic casualties (of all ages), compared with 569 in 2015, and 553 the year before that. This puts Blackburn with Darwen 16th highest out of 152 upper-tier authorities in England when expressed as a rate per resident (or 29th highest as a rate per billion vehicle miles travelled) <em><span class="citation">(DfT <a href="#ref-DfT_tables">2017</a><a href="#ref-DfT_tables">d</a>)</span></em>.</p>
<p>481 of these injuries were slight,<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> 69 were serious, and two were fatal, giving a total of 71 killed or seriously injured <strong>(KSI)</strong> in 2016. If we look at three years combined, Blackburn with Darwen had the 21st highest KSI rate out of 151 upper-tier authorities in 2014-16, and was significantly worse than England <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_download">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_download">x</a>)</span></em>. This is despite the fact that many other police forces (<em>not</em> including our own Lancashire Constabulary) switched to a new reporting system in 2016, which classifies more injuries as ‘serious’ <em><span class="citation">(DfT <a href="#ref-DfT_roadcas">2017</a><a href="#ref-DfT_roadcas">b</a>)</span></em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="pedestrian-casualties" class="section level4">
<h4>Pedestrian Casualties</h4>
<p>In 2016, Blackburn with Darwen had the 7th highest overall rate of pedestrian casualties in England (per 100,000 population), and the highest of all outside London <em><span class="citation">(DfT <a href="#ref-DfT_tables">2017</a><a href="#ref-DfT_tables">d</a>)</span></em>. If we focus on the more serious injuries, Blackburn with Darwen usually has more pedestrian KSIs than car occupant KSIs (Figure <a href="live-well.html#fig:pedksichart">83</a>). This is the opposite of the national picture, where there are consistently at least 50% more car occupant KSIs than pedestrian KSIs <em><span class="citation">(DfT <a href="#ref-DfT_tables">2017</a><a href="#ref-DfT_tables">d</a>)</span></em>.</p>

<p>The rate of pedestrian KSI casualties in Blackburn with Darwen is higher than average for almost every age-group (Figure <a href="live-well.html#fig:pedksibyagechart">84</a>), and significantly so for the youngest residents (aged 0-10) and the oldest (aged 75+).</p>

<h4>Alternative Rates</h4>
<p>All the analysis so far relates to accidents occurring in Blackburn with Darwen, whether the casualty was local or not. Dividing by the resident population to obtain a rate may not therefore seem particularly logical.</p>
<p>An alternative is to count casualties according to where they come from, regardless of where their accident occurred. This is done in a recent report, but for constituencies rather than local authorities <em><span class="citation">(PACTS <a href="#ref-PACTS">2017</a>)</span></em>.</p>
<p>Looking at things this way, the rate of KSI casualties from Blackburn constituency in 2011-16 was 28% higher than the Great Britain average, and for those from Rossendale &amp; Darwen constituency it was 37% higher.</p>
<p>When all severities of casualty are considered (not just KSI), Blackburn constituency comes 13th highest out of 632 constituencies in Great Britain. If we focus on pedestrian casualties alone (of all severities), Blackburn constituency comes second highest in the country, with more than twice the national average rate <em><span class="citation">(PACTS <a href="#ref-PACTS">2017</a>)</span></em>.</p>

<div id="mental-health" class="section level4">
<h4>Mental Health</h4>
<p>Asylum seekers are typically fleeing conflict, political upheaval and persecution, and it has been suggested that over 30% may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result <em><span class="citation">(Shepherd <a href="#ref-Shepherd">2018</a>; Healthwatch <a href="#ref-Healthwatch_asylum">2018</a>)</span></em>. Consultation work with asylum seekers and refugees in Blackburn with Darwen found high levels of depression and anxiety, which may be exacerbated by isolation, boredom, culture shock, money worries, dealings with the Home Office, and the feeling of lack of control over their personal situation <em><span class="citation">(Shepherd <a href="#ref-Shepherd">2018</a>)</span></em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="physical-health" class="section level4">
<h4>Physical Health</h4>
<p>The <em>Blackburn with Darwen Asylum Seekers and Refugees Health Needs Assessment</em> highlights the issue of food poverty and malnutrition among this group. Cooking skills may be inadequate, especially among single men, and familiar foods are often unavailable. Asylum-seeking parents are often unaware of their entitlement to free school meals <em><span class="citation">(Shepherd <a href="#ref-Shepherd">2018</a>)</span></em>.</p>
<p>Asylum seekers and refugees are at higher risk of infectious diseases than the general population, which may partly reflect their living conditions before and during migration. They also present with a high level of chronic non-communicable disease, often including poor dental health and a lack of awareness of dental hygiene <em><span class="citation">(Shepherd <a href="#ref-Shepherd">2018</a>)</span></em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="access-to-health-services" class="section level4">
<h4>Access to Health Services</h4>
<p>Lack of awareness, compounded by the fear of being charged, acts as a barrier to take-up of health services by asylumn seekers and refugees. Strenuous efforts have been made to try and ensure that all those in Blackburn with Darwen register with a GP, but there is a concern that this process is not always seen through to completion <em><span class="citation">(Shepherd <a href="#ref-Shepherd">2018</a>; Healthwatch <a href="#ref-Healthwatch_asylum">2018</a>)</span></em>.</p>
<p>Asylum seekers and refugees report feeling that appointments are rushed. This may partly be due to conflicting expectations, but also reflects the extra time needed to deal with complex issues and language barriers. Translation services may not always be in place, or able to cope with the variety of dialects in use, and are not provided at NHS dentists. Informal arrangements, such as relying on relatives to translate, can lead to a loss of privacy and dignity <em><span class="citation">(Shepherd <a href="#ref-Shepherd">2018</a>; Healthwatch <a href="#ref-Healthwatch_asylum">2018</a>)</span></em>.</p>
