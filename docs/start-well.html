<h3>Child Poverty</h3>
<p>The Child Poverty Act of 2010 pledged that by 2020, no more than 10% of children should be living in families whose income is less than 60% of median household income (before housing costs). However, this target was removed by the Welfare Reform and Work Act of 2016 <em><span class="citation">(House of Commons Library <a href="#ref-HCL_pov">2017</a><a href="#ref-HCL_pov">a</a>)</span></em>.</p>
<div id="children-in-low-income-families-local-measure" class="section level4">
<h4>Children in Low Income Families Local Measure</h4>
<p>HMRC continues to produce its Children in Low-Income Families Local Measure, as a local proxy for the target measure. However, it now attracts relatively little interest, both because the target has been dropped, and because it is always at least 2 years out of date.</p>
</div>
<div id="end-child-poverty-estimates" class="section level4">
<h4>â€˜End Child Povertyâ€™ Estimates</h4>
<p>Much more timely estimates are now produced for the <a href="http://www.endchildpoverty.org.uk/poverty-in-your-area-2018/">End Child Poverty</a> coalition. These also rely on two-year-old tax credit data, but researchers at Loughborough University have found a way of rolling them forward to reflect recent changes in the labour market. The End Child Poverty estimates are usually quoted â€˜after housing costsâ€™, so they cannot be compared with the old target or the HMRC measure.</p>
<p>The latest release is a snapshot as at September 2017. On an â€˜after housing costsâ€™ basis, Blackburn with Darwen had an estimated <strong>16,034</strong> children living in poverty (<strong>39.5%</strong>), which is the 12th highest percentage of any local authority in the UK (average 27%). The parliamentary constituency of Blackburn - i.e.Â excluding Darwen - had <strong>43%</strong> of its children in poverty, putting it 22nd highest out of 650. This had risen from 35% in 2015, which was one of the ten highest increases in the country.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="start-well.html#fig:childpovchart">32</a> shows the proportion of children living in poverty in each BwD ward. The depth of each bar reflects the child population of the ward. With <strong>54.9%</strong> of its children living in poverty, Audley has the 21st highest ward rate in the UK <em><span class="citation">(Loughborough University <a href="#ref-Lough2018">2018</a>; End Child Poverty <a href="#ref-ECP2018">2018</a>)</span></em>.</p>

<h4>Effects of child poverty</h4>

<div class="papers">
<h5 id="what-the-papers-say.">What the papers sayâ€¦.</h5>
New research from the LSE <em><span class="citation">(LSE <a href="#ref-LSE2017">2017</a>)</span></em> finds strong evidence that the poorer outcomes observed among children from low-income families are <em>not</em> solely due to associated factors such as parental education. Household income <em>in itself</em> is proven to be important for childrenâ€™s physical health and social, behavioural and cognitive development. Â

<h4>Early Years Foundation Stage</h4>
<p>The Early Years Foundation Stage profile measures childrenâ€™s development at the end of the school year in which they turn 5. Figure <a href="start-well.html#fig:EYchart">33</a> shows that in 2017, 66% of Blackburn with Darwen children were deemed to have a â€˜goodâ€™ level of development, compared with 56% two years ago. It means that Blackburn with Darwen has risen from third lowest to joint 12th lowest place <em><span class="citation">(DfE <a href="#ref-DfE_early">2017</a><a href="#ref-DfE_early">a</a>)</span></em>.</p>
<p>Within the borough, the inequality between White and Asian pupils has now disappeared. There continues to be a gap between those with and without English as their first language, but it is relatively small. Blackburn with Darwenâ€™s Free School Meals (FSM) pupils still lag their non-FSM peers by 15 percentage points, although the boroughâ€™s ranking has improved.</p>

<h4>Primary Education - Key Stage 2</h4>
<p>At the end of primary education, 60% of Blackburn with Darwen pupils in 2017 achieved the new more stringent â€˜expected standardâ€™ in reading, writing and mathematics (England 62%) <em><span class="citation">(DfE <a href="#ref-DfE_stage2">2017</a><a href="#ref-DfE_stage2">b</a>)</span></em>. There is little difference, either locally or nationally, in the performance of White and Asian pupils, or those with or without English as their first language (Figure <a href="start-well.html#fig:KS2chart">34</a>). Blackburn with Darwen children entitled to Free School Meals (FSM) still do less well than their non-FSM peers, although the gap is not as big as regionally or nationally. On the previous tests, the borough had the second best results outside London for FSM pupils, but that has now slipped to 12th best (or 41st place overall).</p>

<div id="gcse-attainment" class="section level4">
<h4>GCSE Attainment</h4>
<p>The measurement of GCSE attainment becomes ever more complicated, and difficult to compare with previous years. Starting in 2017, English and Maths exams are now graded on a scale of 9 to 1 (where 9 is best). The simplest headline measure of attainment is the percentage of pupils obtaining grade 5 or better in both those subjects.</p>
<p>On this basis, Blackburn with Darwenâ€™s overall score is 42% (Figure <a href="start-well.html#fig:GCSEchart">35</a>), not far off the England average <em><span class="citation">(DfE <a href="#ref-DfE_GCSE">2018</a><a href="#ref-DfE_GCSE">c</a>)</span></em>. The performance of its White pupils, however, is the 19th lowest out of 149 local authorities. It is striking how by this stage, Blackburn with Darwen pupils whose did <em>not</em> have English as their first language are performing better than those who did. The boroughâ€™s results for Free School Meals (FSM) pupils may not seem impressive, but are actually very good compared with most other NW authorities.</p>

<h3>Children in Need</h3>
<p><strong>â€˜Children in Needâ€™</strong> is the DfEâ€™s term for all those referred to the local authority and assessed to be in need of services. Blackburn with Darwen had a total of 1781 Children in Need at the end of March 2017, compared with 1617 two years previously. This equates to 464 per 10,000, against an average of 372 in the NW and 330 for England, putting Blackburn with Darwen just within the highest 20 authorities <em><span class="citation">(DfE <a href="#ref-DfE_Need">2018</a><a href="#ref-DfE_Need">a</a>)</span></em>.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="start-well.html#fig:inNeedchart">36</a> shows the primary reason why these children were assessed as being in need. â€˜Abuse or neglectâ€™ outstrips other reasons by an even greater margin than in the previous Summary Review.</p>

<h3>Looked After Children</h3>
<p>One category of â€˜Children in Needâ€™ is those looked after by the local authority. As at 31st March 2017, there were 370 Blackburn with Darwen children in local authority care, up from 315 two years previously. This equates to 96 per 10,000 children under the age of 18, which remains significantly higher than average (England rate 62 per 10,000), and places the borough in the top quintile nationally <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_vulnCYP">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_vulnCYP">ac</a>)</span></em>.</p>

<h3>Chlamydia Screening</h3>
<p>Chlamydia is a largely hidden condition, so cases are most often discovered through opportunistic screening. The National Chlamydia Screening Programme aims to diagnose and treat as many cases as possible in young people, and local authorities are encouraged to aim for a â€˜Chlamydia Detection Rateâ€™ of at least 2300 per 100,000 15-24 year-olds.</p>
<p>Latest figures for 2017 <em><span class="citation">(PHE <a href="#ref-PHE_chlamydia">2018</a><a href="#ref-PHE_chlamydia">q</a>)</span></em> imply that Blackburn with Darwenâ€™s detection rate is very close to that target, at 2263 per 100,000 (Figure <a href="start-well.html#fig:chlamydiachart">40</a>). The apparent spectacular performance in 2016 is now thought to have been due to data collection issues.</p>

It is the top upper-tier authority for child admissions due to pedestrian casualties, second highest for asthma in the 10-17 age-group, and also ranks in the top five for substance misuse and dental caries (i.e.Â hospital admissions for tooth extraction).
